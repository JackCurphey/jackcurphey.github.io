<h1> Jack Curphey's Article</h1>



<p style="color:white; font-family:sans-serif;"> I had never really realized how important Body Image is to most people before
  starting this article. Although people may not admit it, body image plays quite
   a large part in our lives. People can often spend up to fifteen minutes before
    going out for the day to decide what to wear, worrying about how other think
     that they should look. Body image is a major part in most people's lives and
      affects many aspects of their lives.</br> </p>
 From the article “Women spend nearly one year deciding what to wear” in the Telegraph,
  it is said that women spend on average of sixteen minutes a day choosing what to
   wear, and on average fourteen minutes on the weekend. In a lifetime this amounts
    to about “287 days riffling through their wardrobes” finding what to wear that
     day. One of the questions that I asked my “interviewees” is how much time a
      day they spend deciding what to wear, per day. Some of the answers were: “I
       just grab and go”, or “roughly two or three minutes”. This makes sense, but
        I am assuming that if I asked some other people, the answer could have been
         different. </br></p>

        <p style="color:white; font-family:sans-serif;">Another question I asked them was what they think body image is. “The
          way people view you and the way you view yourself” was one of the answers.
           Another was “how people view you”. I find this very interesting because
            the denotation (from Merriam-Webster) of Body Image is “the subjective
             picture or mental image of one's own body” but the most common answer
              was how others view you. This shows that people are worrying more
              about what others think of them, than what they feel like they should
               look like. The third question I asked was are you happy with your
                body image, or according to their definition, are you happy with
                 how others view you. The answer was always “yes” or “yeah”. This
                  shows that people are happy with how other people view them, not
                   how they think that they look on the outside. This could also
                    mean that they may not be happy with what they look like, but
                     are happy with what society thinks they look like.
Many people take the fact that they do not like their body image a step further:
 “40% of all 9 and 10-year-old girls have already been on a diet “(Just Say Yes),
  “Buttock augmentation with fat grafting (11,505 procedures, up 15 percent from
   2013 to 2014)” (American Society of Plastic Surgeons), “90% of people with eating
    disorders are women between the ages of 12 and 25” (Just Say Yes). This shows
     that the media is showing young teens and adults what the “ideal body image”
      should be, through things like magazines, social media, Television, and people
       are changing their body to look like these people.</br></p>

<p style="color:white; font-family:sans-serif;"> 	Even celebrities are taking part in changing the way you look: Michael Jackson
   turned himself white through plastic surgery, because he wanted to achieve his
    ideal of perfection, which took him nearly thirty years, and roughly one-hundred
     operations (Daily Mail). People all around the world are seeing plastic surgery
      as a way to change your outer appearance, just as would be done in a video
       game. They think that they will be accepted if they look a certain way,
       which is decided by the media. Of the teens that I interviewed all of them
       said that they do not like the effects of plastic surgery, would never get
        it, and suggest that nobody should ever get it. One of the interviewees
        even went further and said that plastic surgery is the wrong way to go
        about changing the way you look, and the right way would be to exercise,
         which is free and does not make you feel guilty or regretful later in life.
          Another question I asked was “Do the clothes that you wear affect how you feel,
           and how should they?” and the responses were “They should reflect your
            beliefs and make you feel good”, meaning that if you do not believe
            in guns, for example, then do not wear a shirt that says “Pro Guns”.
	One way to keep a positive Body Image is by always keeping positive and accepting
   who you are by being kind to your body, and not abusing it by extreme diets or
    making yourself sick.
   When I asked “what do you think affects your body image the most” to my group
    of interviewees, they all replied with, “attitude” or how you do things. This
     shows that no matter what clothes you are
   wearing, the way you act is the most noticeable. </p>
