<p style="color:white;">Stress comes from almost everything. Most adults experience stress from things like taxes, bills, deadlines, insurance, and important financial and work related issues. But teens also experience lots of stress. Teens experience stress from things like body image, self esteem, grades, careers, getting into college, what their parents think, what their friends, peer pressure, the list goes on and on. Teens experience a very large amount of stress
	Teens and Adults both feel stress, but it might be that they experience and define stress differently. A real adult defined it as,“Stress is negative feelings felt by physical or psychological pressure.” A real teenager said it differently, “Stress is simply put, worrying about things.” So there are things that both teens and adults think of stress, but what actually is stress?
Stress is the body’s physical reaction to problems and pressures that affect someone. When a person gets stressed out their body starts producing hormones. Adrenaline and cortisol start being pulsed through the body to try to help your body cope with the stressful situation at hand. Glucose runs through the bloodstream to give the body energy and sweat starts dripping from the pores to keep the person cool. Now when a small dose can help a person do better too much of these hormones are very unhealthy for a body. Overdose of stress hormones can cause headaches, loss of sleep, chest pain, and depression. These effects can lead to a person abusing drugs or alcohol and can lead to social withdrawal as a form of dealing with the pain. These symptoms can come from all sorts of problems.
	What causes stress for teens and young adults? Stress comes from almost every aspect of a teen’s life. From school there is stress to get good grades and get into college, plus stress from late night projects. From home there is stress from siblings, possibly separating parents, and pressure to get into college or get a certain job. From friends there is pressure to try drugs or alcohol, look, dress, or act in a certain way. And from the sports team there is pressure to have a certain body type or get onto the team. According to a study done by Sutter Health, 55% of teen stress comes from school and academic related problems, 15% from parents and family related issues, 9% from social life, 8% from over-scheduling, 4% from sports, and 9% from other problems. There are stressors everywhere and learning to cope with those stressors is very important.
	Both our adult and teenager had to say that they felt the most stress dealing with things like friends and school work. Our adult had this to say about teen drama, “A lot of my friends were stressing about serious problems that were going on at home, with their parents. I stressed about doing welland making good connections in High School.” And our teen agreed with it by saying this, “I experienced the most stress near the end of Middle School, when I frantically tried to bring my grades up as best as I could.”
	Ways to people deal with stress vary from taking long naps, to using and abusing medication, to inflicting self harm upon oneself. Stress can lead people to drug addiction, alcohol abuse, and tobacco use. Furthermore stress alone left untreated can lead to social withdrawal and depression. People also inflict self harm on themselves as a way of making them feel better. Self harm can manifest itself in many ways. These can include pinching, biting, hair pulling, and cutting. Although these may seem like drastic measures, people can go to these things as way of relieving pain temporarily. Self harm can become an addiction and when you see someone starting to fall into a habit of abuse and self harm it is very important to catch them and help them get on track.
	My interviewees each had their own opinions on this matter. When asked, our adult said this about identifying and helping someone who is too stressed out, “If someone seems like they are dealing with a lot of stress, go and help them out by being there for them and comforting them when they are down.” Our teen had this opinion, “If someone seems shut out or removed check in with them and see how they are doing.” Whatever may be the circumstances, take this steps to helping someone who you think is dealing with too much stress in a negative or destructive way:
</br></p>
<p style="color:white;">
Approach them as a friend, ask them how they are
Inquire about their problem, but don’t be too accusatory or aggressive
If they don’t want to talk with you but you can tell they are on a bad track, talk to a trusted adult and tell them about this person’s problem
</br></p>
<p style="color:white;">
	They are, of course positive ways to deal with stress which we have some excellent tips on if you yourself begin to feel stressed out. First of all, take a break from whatever is stressing you out. Remove yourself from the problem for a little bit and spend some time outside, or go exercise. Although you may not want to, exercise is one of the best ways to circulate your blood and get you feeling great. Eat foods like fruits and vegetables and stay away from caffeine and sugar. Stimulants like caffeine and sugar will actually keep your body in a state of stress. Drinking lots of water is another great way to cleanse your body and feel calm. While working, keeping an upright posture while help you from back pain and further stress. You can only put off stress inducing work for so long, sometimes you need to follow Nike’s advice: Just Do It.
Our adult agreed with our “Nike Tip”,“I think the best way to deal with stress is just to hunker down and finish what you need to finish.” Our teen had the same opinion,“Just get to work on whatever is stressing you out and get it done, in other words, just do it.”
	If you are ever feeling stressed go through these great tips and remember that knowledge is power. The more you know about stress, the better you can help your friends deal with it and deal with it yourself.
